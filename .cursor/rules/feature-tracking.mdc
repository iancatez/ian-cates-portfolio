# Feature Tracking & Planning Standards

## 1. Feature Set Organization

Features must be organized into logical **Task Groups** in `AGENT_TASKS.md`. This structure ensures modular development and clear dependency management.

### Task Group Structure
Each task group MUST include:
- **Header**: `## Feature #[N]: [Name]` or `## Task Group [N]: [Name]` (for legacy compatibility)
- **Feature Number**: Sequential numbering starting from 1
- **Metadata Block**:
  - `Feature #`: Sequential feature number
  - `Status`: Pending | In Progress | Completed | Blocked
  - `Dependencies`: List of required Feature/Task Group numbers or "None"
  - `Can Run In Parallel`: Yes/No (and conditions)
  - `Estimated Time`: Time estimate in minutes/hours
- **Requirements**: Explicit, well-defined requirements for the feature (what it should do, not how)
- **Tasks List**: Numbered list of specific, actionable implementation items
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Checklist of requirements for completion

### Example
```markdown
## Feature #1: Hero Button Transition Enhancement
**Feature #**: 1
**Status**: Pending
**Dependencies**: None
**Can Run In Parallel**: Yes
**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

### Requirements:
- Hero section buttons ("View Projects" and "About Me") must have smooth, polished transitions when clicked/selected
- Transitions should feel responsive and provide clear visual feedback
- No jarring or abrupt state changes
- Transitions should work consistently across all button variants

### Tasks:
1. **Analyze current button transition behavior**
   - Review `components/hero-section.tsx` button implementation
   - Identify current transition gaps or issues
   - Document desired transition behavior

2. **Enhance button transitions**
   - Add smooth state transitions for active/focus states
   - Implement click feedback animations
   - Ensure transitions respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Button transitions are smooth and polished
- [ ] Visual feedback is clear on interaction
- [ ] No jarring state changes
- [ ] Respects accessibility preferences
- [ ] Build succeeds
```

## 2. Planning Process

Before starting any new major feature or refactor:

1.  **Check `AGENT_TASKS.md`**: Verify if the work is already defined.
2.  **Define New Feature/Task Group**: If not defined, create a new entry following the structure above.
   - Use `Feature #[N]` format for new features (preferred)
   - Use `Task Group [N]` format for legacy compatibility
   - Assign the next sequential number
3.  **Define Explicit Requirements**: Clearly state WHAT the feature should do (requirements), not HOW (implementation details).
4.  **Identify Dependencies**: Clearly state what must be done before this work can start (by Feature/Task Group number).
5.  **Estimate Effort**: Provide a realistic time estimate.
6.  **Review**: Ensure the new feature fits logically into the Execution Order Summary.

## 3. Progress Tracking

- **Status Updates**: Update the `Status` field in `AGENT_TASKS.md` as work progresses (Pending → In Progress → Completed).
- **Feature Numbers**: Use sequential Feature # numbering. Track the highest number to assign the next one.
- **Checklists**: Mark acceptance criteria as completed `[x]` only when verified.
- **Requirements Documentation**: Keep requirements explicit and well-defined. Update if scope changes.
- **Current Status**: Keep the "Current Status" section at the bottom of `AGENT_TASKS.md` updated with the high-level state of the project.

## 4. Execution Order Summary

Maintain a high-level `Execution Order Summary` in `AGENT_TASKS.md` to visualize the critical path and parallel tracks.

### Structure
```markdown
## Execution Order Summary

### Phase 1: Foundation (Parallel)
- Task Group 1: [Name]

### Phase 2: Components (Sequential after Phase 1)
- Task Group 2: [Name]
```

## 5. Branching Strategy Integration

- **One Branch Per Feature/Task Group**: As defined in `git-workflow.mdc`, create a dedicated branch for each Feature or Task Group.
- **Naming**: 
  - For Features: `feature-[number]-[kebab-case-name]` (e.g., `feature-13-hero-button-transitions`)
  - For Task Groups: `task-group-[number]-[kebab-case-name]` (legacy format)
- **Completion**: A Feature/Task Group is complete only when its branch is merged.

## 6. Anti-Patterns (What NOT to do)

- **Do NOT** start work without a defined Task Group.
- **Do NOT** modify multiple Task Groups in a single branch.
- **Do NOT** leave `AGENT_TASKS.md` outdated. Update it as you go.
- **Do NOT** create vague tasks like "Fix bugs". Be specific about *which* bugs.
