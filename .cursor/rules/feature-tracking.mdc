# Feature Tracking & Planning Standards

## 1. Feature Set Organization

Features must be organized into logical **Task Groups** in `AGENT_TASKS.md`. This structure ensures modular development and clear dependency management.

### Task Group Structure
Each task group MUST include:
- **Header**: `## Task Group [N]: [Name]`
- **Metadata Block**:
  - `Status`: Pending | In Progress | Completed | Blocked
  - `Dependencies`: List of required Task Groups or "None"
  - `Can Run In Parallel`: Yes/No (and conditions)
  - `Estimated Time`: Time estimate in minutes/hours
- **Tasks List**: Numbered list of specific, actionable items
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Checklist of requirements for completion

### Example
```markdown
## Task Group 1: Core Animation Setup
**Status**: Pending
**Dependencies**: None
**Can Run In Parallel**: Yes
**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

### Tasks:
1. **Install Framer Motion**
   - Run: `npm install framer-motion`
   - Verify: Check package.json

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Framer Motion installed
- [ ] Build succeeds
```

## 2. Planning Process

Before starting any new major feature or refactor:

1.  **Check `AGENT_TASKS.md`**: Verify if the work is already defined.
2.  **Define New Task Group**: If not defined, create a new Task Group following the structure above.
3.  **Identify Dependencies**: Clearly state what must be done before this work can start.
4.  **Estimate Effort**: Provide a realistic time estimate.
5.  **Review**: Ensure the new group fits logically into the Execution Order Summary.

## 3. Progress Tracking

- **Status Updates**: Update the `Status` field in `AGENT_TASKS.md` as work progresses.
- **Checklists**: Mark acceptance criteria as completed `[x]` only when verified.
- **Current Status**: Keep the "Current Status" section at the bottom of `AGENT_TASKS.md` updated with the high-level state of the project.

## 4. Execution Order Summary

Maintain a high-level `Execution Order Summary` in `AGENT_TASKS.md` to visualize the critical path and parallel tracks.

### Structure
```markdown
## Execution Order Summary

### Phase 1: Foundation (Parallel)
- Task Group 1: [Name]

### Phase 2: Components (Sequential after Phase 1)
- Task Group 2: [Name]
```

## 5. Branching Strategy Integration

- **One Branch Per Task Group**: As defined in `git-workflow.mdc`, create a dedicated branch for each Task Group.
- **Naming**: `task-group-[number]-[kebab-case-name]`
- **Completion**: A Task Group is complete only when its branch is merged.

## 6. Anti-Patterns (What NOT to do)

- **Do NOT** start work without a defined Task Group.
- **Do NOT** modify multiple Task Groups in a single branch.
- **Do NOT** leave `AGENT_TASKS.md` outdated. Update it as you go.
- **Do NOT** create vague tasks like "Fix bugs". Be specific about *which* bugs.
